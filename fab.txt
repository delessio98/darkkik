toying around with some FloatingActionButton edits on darkKik

documentation for kik's fab can be found here
https://github.com/Clans/FloatingActionButton

a simple example can be found here
https://github.com/Clans/FloatingActionButton/blob/master/sample/src/main/res/layout/menus_fragment.xml


my goal here is to move the fab to the bottom center of the screen and have the labels to the right of the fab icons

recompiling now wish me luck even though im the only one who reads these lol
