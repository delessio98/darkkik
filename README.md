 2. Integrated firewall that blocks unsigned/malformed xmpp from unoffical IP addresses or locations (wink wink, a small group 
 within the kik modding community has begun to use xmpp to lock users out of there accounts permanently. There is currently no fix after your account has been bricked, this feature will do it's best to protect you from this, but you could also just not piss off those said people)

1. You can theme pretty good, modify layouts and colors, custom drawables and backgrounds
2. You are able to add mods to darkKik (and port them to future updates)
3. You can add custom popups or a pastebin popop / update checker (i RLY need an update checker soon lmao)

# Terms of use
1. This is 100% open source, use any of this code or modify darkKiK in any way you would like, just clarify it's not an official release 
2. If you plan on using this to make your own mod, i will not add it into offical darkKK realeases, as that is only for other
darkKiK themes.
3. If you've made a custom theme and would like it to be added to the themes folder (coming soon), follow these steps

 3b. Upload your modified apk and the .zip file to mediafire and message me on kik (@kanxerous)

 3d. If your theme is accepted you will be added to our themer list and be included in future credits of darkKik, aswell as putting yourself as co-dev for your specific .apk
4. If you discover how to unlock paid themes, keep it to yourself. If kik gets wind of people unlocking paid themes and accessing the kin marketplace before it launches, they may remove it from A/B until the official release, or cancel it entirely. Please be responsible and those who do decide to leak it will be banned from any hyperkik and darkkik groups aswell as blacklisted from any of my projects.
