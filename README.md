# Announcements

darkKik 14.10 v2 is in the works ! I have a lot planned for this release and new settings !

# Changelog (v14.9 v2)

2. Fixed Crop Activity background
3. Fixed Kik Browser bugs (url color, dividers, etc)
4. Added a sexy background for the welcome screen, settings screen, and conversations screen
5. Moved the fab to center of convo list (this is just for testing and will be removed from the final apk unless somebody actually wants it)
6. Modified the app bar background to *almost seamlessly* blend with the conversation screen background
7. Added an About and Changelog to darkKik settings
8. Reworked Settings Menu's
9. Added a developer team section (just placeholders for now until i get usernames and descriptions sorted out)
10. Request all permissions on startup (hit ' dont ask again ' to avoid it continuously popping up)
11. Font Size Increased by 15% for better readability on custom background 
12. Support for newer phablets / larger phones (ex. S8+, S9, Note 9, etc)
13. Support for Multi Window / Split Screen (android 7.0 +, with exceptions for certain samsung and LG devices)
14. Moved Developer Team Section to seperate menu (reduces setting clutter)


# Features
1. Complete Black UI with a two-tone Teal accent color
2. Unlocked A/B Testing menu (unlocks a plethora of customization options)
3. Patched a bunch of unicode crash codes (causes an overflow in the run time by trying to parse an invalid unicode string
as a website and crashes the main application thread)
  3a. There are hundreds of unicode crash codes so most likely somebody will be able to crash you, i just patched the newer / 
  popular ones
  
 # What's Next
 Features that I *plan* on having ready for the next kik update
 1. Read Reciepts, No Pull, and Disable Typing
 2. Integrated firewall that blocks unsigned/malformed xmpp from unoffical IP addresses or locations (wink wink, a small group 
 within the kik modding community has begun to use xmpp to lock users out of there accounts permanently. There is currently no fix after your account has been bricked, this feature will do it's best to protect you from this, but you could also just not piss off those said people)
