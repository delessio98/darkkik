Reorganize settings screen (merge most settings to one preference screen)
Add developer credit section
Add about popup
Add changelog popup
Add update checker (idk if i should have it check automatically when the app updates or when they press a button? We'll see what happens lol)
Add better icons (doing it now)
No sense in obfuscation as its open source so im gonna make the apk break apkeditor. Any half intelligent dev will be using a pc (hopefully linux LOL) and apktool / dex2jar
Change bubble text? Im lazy and its a smali edit so this wont come for a lil bit (feel free to help :) )
